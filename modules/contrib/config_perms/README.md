# Custom Permissions

This very lightweight module allows additional permissions to be created and
managed through an administration form. It uses the menu access system to allow
or dissalow access.

On an administration page, a user is able to create a permission with name and
paths. These permissions can then be assigned to roles on the permissions page.

The name of the module has been changed from "Site Configuration Permissions"
to "Custom Permissions" to reflect the current state of the module. The new
name is used in the 7.x version and above.
